# Kana Table

I'm learning Japanese, and a common task I perform regularly to improve my
writing, reading and recall is to practice my Hiragana and Katakana.

One problem I found with this is that it becomes a routine exercise. I suspect
that I am becoming good at writing あ then い then う, etc. rather than good
at writing an arbitrary character on demand.

As well as that, this method does not help one get better at recognising
common strings such as こんにちは or ありがとう or even suffixes -です.

I began writing tables of Romanised Kana in random orders, sometimes putting
two characters next to each other so I could practice recalling them together.

After only a couple of attempts at doing this manually I saw that there was
an opportunity here to automate something. That's what Kana Table is for.
